Eureka Labs is building the next-generation block builder for Ethereum. This means processing vast volumes of transactions in real time, simulating them, and assembling them into blocks at the same pace as the network itself. Achieving this demands extreme throughput, ultra-low latency, and rock-solid reliability - the system must handle transactions in peak moments without bottlenecks or failures.

To meet these challenges, we turn to Rust, with its unique mix of performance and safety. By combining concurrency with an actor-based architecture, we design lightweight, independent components that coordinate seamlessly at scale, keeping the system both efficient and resilient.
