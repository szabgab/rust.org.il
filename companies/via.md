We're Via, and we build technology that changes the way the world moves. Weâ€™re driven by a simple mission: to create modern and efficient public transportation systems that provide far greater access to jobs, healthcare, and education. With our best in class suite of products, we make transit thrive.

We recently began adopting Rust within our Algorithms group - currently for building Python extensions, with additional use cases planned for the future. At Via, we develop a highly complex, real-time, large scale system that must be resilient, secure, fast, and maintainable, making Rust an ideal fit for our needs.

We also organized a four-day Rust workshop, and you can explore all the materials on the [site](https://tomshlomo.github.io/rust-with-via/index.html) we published.

Feel free to reach out to [Tom Shlomo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-shlomo/) if you're interested in learning more.
