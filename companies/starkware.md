StarkWare is an Israeli deep-tech company developing a platform that enables scalable transactions on blockchain. Our technology is based on zero-knowledge cryptographic proofs: connecting a theoretical model with practical computer science, significantly streamlining transaction verification and solving the scalability challenge. This makes it possible to execute thousands, and even tens of thousands, of transactions per second on the Ethereum network.

To handle the complexity of the computations and proofs we run, we need a language that is both highly efficient and extremely safe, especially in memory management. That’s why we are currently migrating our entire codebase from Python to Rust – a move that makes the system more robust, resilient to developer errors, and capable of delivering top-tier performance.

In addition, we developed Cairo – a unique programming language for building applications on our network, inspired by Rust. Cairo was born out of our drive to always stay at the forefront of technology, giving developers modern, relevant tools and a solid, safe, and efficient foundation at scale.

Rust is a cutting-edge language, positioned at the very top of the programming world – and that’s exactly where we aim to be. Using Rust reflects StarkWare’s technological mindset: choosing the very best tools to build infrastructure that is trustworthy, scalable, and efficient.
