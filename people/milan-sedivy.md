I'm a chill software engineer who spends too much time at his computer :). I started programming early, took a detour into mathematics, and now I work professionally in software engineering. My interests range from low-level engineering and distributed systems to reverse engineering and analyzing how things work under the hood. I’ve had the opportunity to build production-grade systems in Rust, and in my spare time I mentor high school students and early career engineers, sharing both technical depth and a love for problem-solving.
