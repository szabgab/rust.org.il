title: Companies in Israel using Rust
description: List of companies In Israel that use Rust along with some information on what they use it for.
---

On this page we try to showcase all the companies in Israel that use Rust. We include local companies and international companies that have a local office where some people write Rust.
For each company we try to include some explanation what they use Rust for and some "evidence". e.g. A link to a presentation they gave. The fact that they hosted a Rust event. If they have Open Source projects written in Rust.

If you know about more companies, if you know more details about the use of Rust in these companies, if you have other evidence that they use Rust, please send a [Pull-Request](https://github.com/szabgab/rust.org.il/) to improve this page.

Eureka Labs is building the next-generation block builder for Ethereum. This means processing vast volumes of transactions in real time, simulating them, and assembling them into blocks at the same pace as the network itself. Achieving this demands extreme throughput, ultra-low latency, and rock-solid reliability - the system must handle transactions in peak moments without bottlenecks or failures.

To meet these challenges, we turn to Rust, with its unique mix of performance and safety. By combining concurrency with an actor-based architecture, we design lightweight, independent components that coordinate seamlessly at scale, keeping the system both efficient and resilient.

Tabnine's Unique Rust Architecture

Tabnine is an AI code assistant built to integrate seamlessly into the developer’s workflow. Its
architecture combines the power of server-side infrastructure with a strong, lightweight presence
on the client side—right where the developer’s code and IDE reside.

At the heart of this client-side presence is Tabnine’s Rust application, a core component that
makes the product stand out. Unlike many developer tools that rely solely on the cloud, Tabnine
runs directly on millions of end-user machines, across multiple operating systems and
architectures. This approach ensures speed, reliability, and flexibility in real-world coding
environments.

The Rust application itself brings several unique capabilities:

* **Massive scale**: installed on millions of devices worldwide.
* **Cross-platform execution**: runs smoothly on diverse operating systems and hardware.
* **Self-managed updates**: powered by an in-house auto-update mechanism.
* **Local persistence**: capable of spinning up both a vector database and a relational database on the client side.
* **Robust connectivity**: supports secure communication with Tabnine’s servers in varied
network conditions, including certificate-based authentication and proxy environments.

This combination of large-scale deployment, advanced local functionality, and secure
connectivity makes Tabnine’s Rust application a rare example of client-side AI software that is
both powerful and production-ready. It bridges the gap between cloud AI inference and the
day-to-day developer experience, ensuring that Tabnine feels not just like a tool, but like an
integral coding companion.

2. By leveraging Rust’s safety and performance, we’re building core endpoint capabilities that detect, monitor, and prevent data exfiltration at scale.


## TODO

* If the companies have open source projects in Rust, link to them.
* Add more details explaining the type of applications each one writes in Rust.
* Link to the presentation given by employees of each company.
* Add contact info. (e.g. a community member)
