title: Companies in Israel using Rust
description: List of companies In Israel that use Rust along with some information on what they use it for.
---

On this page we try to showcase all the companies in Israel that use Rust. We include local companies and international companies that have a local office where some people write Rust.
For each company we try to include some explanation what they use Rust for and some "evidence". e.g. A link to a presentation they gave. The fact that they hosted a Rust event. If they have Open Source projects written in Rust.

If you know about more companies, if you know more details about the use of Rust in these companies, if you have other evidence that they use Rust, please send a [Pull-Request](https://github.com/szabgab/rust.org.il/) to improve this page.

Eureka Labs is building the next-generation block builder for Ethereum. This means processing vast volumes of transactions in real time, simulating them, and assembling them into blocks at the same pace as the network itself. Achieving this demands extreme throughput, ultra-low latency, and rock-solid reliability - the system must handle transactions in peak moments without bottlenecks or failures.

To meet these challenges, we turn to Rust, with its unique mix of performance and safety. By combining concurrency with an actor-based architecture, we design lightweight, independent components that coordinate seamlessly at scale, keeping the system both efficient and resilient.
