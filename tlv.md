### 2019.03.11 - [Redis modules and a production story](https://www.meetup.com/rust-tlv/events/259099506/)

Rust TLV is back with two exciting talks, and at a new venue - this time [SimilarWeb](https://www.similarweb.com/) will be hosting us at their amazing offices!

* Rust - a (Pre)production Story by [Yoav Yanilov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yoav-yanilov/)
In this talk, I'll walk you through my first experience with Rust, a drop-in replacement for an IO-bound and CPU-intensive production service, performing parallel in-memory aggregations on high-volume compressed text.
We'll see how the Rust implementation reduced memory footprint and improved CPU utilization. We'll also highlight some of the popular 3rd-party crates I used in the process (tokio, hyper, and rusoto), and examine a quirk or two.

Yoav is a software developer at SimilarWeb, working on the B2B platform backend, where he likes to tackle infrastructure and design challenges.

* Developing Redis Modules in Rust by [Gavrie Philipson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gavrie/)

Redis is well known and loved in the open source world. It has long been possible to write modules for Redis, but so far this has been done mostly in C. This is due to Redis itself being written in C, and its API being in the form of a C header file.
It's not easy to write code that is both memory-safe and performant, which is what Rust excels at. This makes it a natural match for writing modules for Redis: They running in the same memory space as Redis, and a bad memory access can crash the whole process.
Writing bindings between Rust and C code is not hard. Our main challenge has been (and still is) to come up with a clean, safe and idiomatic Rust API that hides all the ugly stuff and allows easily writing modules.

Gavrie's current role is Cluster Architect at Redis Labs. He has been hacking away for far too many years at a variety of startup companies. On a never-ending quest for the ultimate programming language, recent favorites have included Kotlin, Go and Python. Since starting with Rust he hasn't looked back.

### 2018.12.09 - [Intro for C\C++ Developers, SGX and Cargo](https://www.meetup.com/rust-tlv/events/256141472/)

* A feature-wise introduction for C/C++ programmers, part 1/3 by [Dan Aloni](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aloni/):

This talk will focuse on Move semantics and Pattern matching, explaining their importance and the differences from the decades-old C / C++ arena.

[Dan Aloni](https://blog.aloni.org/) develops software for more than 20 years. Dan is the original author of coLinux (wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_Linux), has worked on the Linux kernel, gained specialty in virtualization, storage systems, niche languages and operating systems. Currently, Dan is an independent consultant, and helps maintaining the Rust plugin for Vim.

* SGX by [Isan Rivkin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isan-rivkin/):
Intel SGX protects selected code and data from disclosure or modification. Developers can partition their application into processor-hardened enclaves or protected areas of execution in memory that increase security even on compromised platforms. The talk will focus on understanding SGX and how it can be used with the Rust-SDK that was released not so long ago.

Enigma is an open-source project building a decentralized network in Rust for private computations.
Isan is working on the Networking, p2p, system architecture and Hardware (SGX).

* A deeper look at Cargo by [Anton Weiss](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonweiss/):
Cargo is arguably one of the best things about Rust. Not every new language comes with a mature build and package manager out of the box. Let's take a deeper look at this great tool and peek into some of its less known corners.

Anton Weiss is the Principal Consultant at Otomato Software. Internationally acclaimed speaker and trainer in the fields of software delivery and collaboration. Became interested in Rust for hobby projects about half a year ago.

### 2018.10.23 - [Under The Hood, Electrum](https://www.meetup.com/rust-tlv/events/254349265/)

Hosted by [Healthy.io](https://healthy.io/).

* Rust Under The Hood by [Isan Rivkin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isan-rivkin/):

Ownership is the breakout feature of Rust. It allows Rust to be completely memory-safe and efficient while avoiding garbage collection with a set of strict rules.
Rust enforces these rules through lifetimes. Lifetimes are effectively just names for scopes somewhere in the program.
In this session, we'll talk about how these concepts work, how to embrace it and the mental model of a Rust developer.

Yuval Adam is a full stack developer, freelance consultant and a Rustacean in the making

* Rusty Life by [Noam Tenne](https://www.linkedin.com/in/noam-tenne/):

Rust may be a server side language, but it doesn't have to cower in the shadows. In this session we'll talk about how we can prettify our Rust programs using a GUI built with Cursive.

Noam is a hacker-hearted symmathecist. He's been working on both cloud based and on-premise platforms, gaining much experience in building scalable, mission critical web applications and microservices. He's now wreaking havoc at Healthy.io

* Rust In Production by [Daniel Brodie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielbrodie/) CTO & Co-Founder at [Cynerio](https://www.cynerio.com/):

At a startup, moving from a small and badly developed prototype to an initial working prototype, is an important baby step that is difficult to get right. At Cynerio, we leverage Rust to allow us to deal with the complexity of handling 1-10 Gbps of traffic at the hospital's network, while parsing obscure and problematic protocols, running machine learning algorithms, and staying fault tolerant and secure. We will show how we did a gradual and iterative shift from the experimental Python code to production quality Rust and how we are using performance analytics to improve performance going forward. We will also share how our core developers, who haven't known rust, have handled the on-boarding process.

Daniel Brodie is the CTO & Co-Founder of Cynerio, a cyber security startup aimed at protecting hospital's most sensitive entities - their medical devices. Before that Daniel led the research team and a development team in Lacoon, til it was acquired by Checkpoint. Daniel has been a huge fan of hipster programming languages for many years and has fallen in love with rust 3 years ago.
