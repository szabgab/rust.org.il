A talk about abusing Rustlang's formal grammar rules.

Rust, chaos, and a chance to win your very own Ferris.

Come see what happens when programming is about fun, not clean code.

Programming isn’t always about writing the cleanest, most production-ready code. Sometimes, it’s about experimenting, breaking things, and making colleagues confused about what the heck you just wrote and why does it compile.

In this talk, we’ll take a playful look at what happens when you push Rust (and your brain cells) in unusual directions. Along the way, we’ll celebrate clever design choices in Rust, dabble in some esoteric examples, and remind ourselves that programming should be fun.

Come for the Rust, stay for the chaos.

Oh and throughout the presentation you will have a chance to win your very own Ferris the crab!
