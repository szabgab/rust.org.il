For the past year [Nuvoton Technologies](https://nuvoton.co.il/) has been developing its next generation BMC device for the cloud computing.
This chip will include a [Caliptra RoT](https://github.com/chipsalliance/Caliptra) open-source IP. This project is developed in Rust by the community.
Nuvoton is integrating the Caliptra and extending it to support our HW.
In this talk, we will cover our experience as old-school C programmers switching to Rust. Pros and cons.
